The **React ToDo App** is a task management application built to help users keep track of their daily tasks. The app features an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily add, delete, and manage tasks. Developed using **React**, **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and **HTML5**, the application ensures type safety and modular styling, enhancing both the development experience and user interaction.
